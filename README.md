SwaveSplit 1.0 is  digital seismological analysis and processing software, mainly used for the calculation and analysis of shear-wave splitting. Other functions include: waveform data editing, calculus calculation, filtering, elimination of instrument response, calculation of signal-to-noise ratio, etc. SwaveSplit 1.0 is compact, convenient, practical, and easy to operate.

SwaveSplit是一款数字地震学分析处理软件，主要用于横波分裂的相关计算分析研究。其它功能还包括：波形数据编辑、微积分计算、滤波、消除仪器响应、计算信噪比等。SwaveSplit具有小巧方便、实用性强、易于操作的特点。



# Install

- If you don't have MATLAB on your computer, you have 2 options:

  1. Install MATLAB(R2010b) or a higher version of MATLAB first, 

     - then you can download all the source code (including *.m and *.fig etc.) and run "MainSwave.m"  to start SwaveSplit 1.0.

     - or download and install the "setup.exe", then start SwaveSplit 1.0 through the desktop shortcut or "SwaveSplit.exe" in the installation directory (For Windows only).

  2. Install "MCR installer.exe" which is the MATLAB Function Library, then download and install the "setup.exe" to start SwaveSplit 1.0 (For Windows only).

- If you have already installed MATLAB(R2010b) or a higher version of MATLAB on your device, you can either run "MainSwave.m"  or  install the "setup.exe"to start SwaveSplit 1.0.

Actually, I wrote the FORTRAN code for SwaveSplit at the first place, it works as the same as the MATLAB code. If anyone is still interested in the FORTRAN version code, please feel free to contact me.
